my life has changed a lot in the past 12 months.  i've had a lot of fun, made a lot of memories and cherish the time i've spent with the people i love.

i spent time on and off the bike with wes

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
but nothing was more profound than the day i met Erin Marie McLaughin.
<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

she is the most incredible woman i have ever met.

i am continually amazed that i was able to wrangle such a talented, passionate, caring and intelligent cowgirl.

Erin has changed my life in so many ways.

i honestly feel born anew.

she is the love of my life.
