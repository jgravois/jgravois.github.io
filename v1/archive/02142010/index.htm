dearest joy,<br>
happy valentine's day sweetheart!  i am so proud of you for moving to the most exciting city in the world, but i miss you dearly.<br>
i can't wait to see you in three days, and i can't wait to come to bushwick to visit you and ride bikes and watch slow motion rollerskating.<br>
our trip to new york last year was probably the best vacation i've ever taken.  and believe me, i've taken a lot of vacations.<br>
you are so fun to be with, and i am so grateful for your insistence on going rafting and ice skating and riding bikes to state fairs and a million other adventures.<br>
im also completely content to stay at home and watch the simpsons.  as long as you are in my bed with me.
<br>
<br>
i love you joy gardner. i'll see you soon.
