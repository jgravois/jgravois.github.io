dearest joy,
<br><br>
happy valentine's day sweetheart!  i'm sorry that i didn't come up with an entirely different way of letting you know how much i care about you, but traditions can be fun too.  once again, a visit is imminent and i am incredibly excited to show you my new house.  its been a long year, and i still don't quite know how i feel about this place.  i am trying to make the best of it, but i know it will feel a lot more like home as soon as you arrive.
<br><br>
i still remember laying in bed with you in your apartment on i street, staring at the ceiling and giggling while harriet and maynard played in the kitchen.  i felt so close to you then.  and while the distance can be challenging at times, 3,000 miles really hasn't changed anything.
<br><br>
i love you joy marie(?) gardner.
<br><br>
i'll see you soon.
