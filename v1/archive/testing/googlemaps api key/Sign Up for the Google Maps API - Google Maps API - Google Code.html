  <P>The Google Maps API lets you embed Google Maps in your own web pages. 
A single Maps API key is valid for a single "directory" or domain. 
See this <A href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/faq.html#keysystem">FAQ</A> for more information. 
You must have a <A href="http://www.google.com/accounts/">Google Account</A> 
to get a Maps API key, and your API key will be connected to your Google Account.</P>

<P>Here are some highlights from the terms for those of you who aren't lawyers:</P>

<BR>
<B>1. Your relationship with Google.</B><BR>
<BR>
1.1    <U>Use of the Service is Subject to these Terms</U>.  Your use of
any of the Google Maps/Google Earth APIs (referred to in this document as
the "<B>Maps API(s)</B>" or the "<B>Service</B>") is subject to the terms
of a legal agreement between you and Google Inc., whose principal place
of business is at 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California
94043, United States ("<B>Google</B>").  This legal agreement is referred
to as the <B>"Terms"</B>.<BR>
<BR>
1.2    <U>The Terms include Google's Legal Notices and Privacy
Policy</U>. <BR>
<BR>

<DIV style="margin-left: 40px;">

(a)  Unless otherwise agreed in writing with Google, the Terms will include the 
 following: <BR>

<DIV style="margin-left: 40px;">
               (i) the terms and conditions set forth in this document
               (the <B>"Maps APIs Terms"</B>);<BR>
               (ii) the <A title="Legal Notices" target="_top" href="http://www.google.com/intl/en-us/help/legalnotices_maps.html" id="o56t">Legal Notices</A>; and<BR>
               (iii) the <A title="Privacy Policy" href="http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html" target="_top" id="fd26">Privacy Policy</A>.<BR>
</DIV>
<BR>
         (b) Before you use the Maps APIs, you should read each of the
         documents comprising the Terms, and print or save a local copy
         for your records.<BR>

</DIV>

 <BR>
1.3    <U>Use of Other Google Services and Additional Terms</U>.  If you
use the Maps APIs in conjunction with any other Google products or
services, including any other Google API, (collectively, the Service and
all other Google products and services are referred to as the "<B>Google
Services</B>"), your agreement with Google will also include the terms
applicable to those Google Services. All of these are referred to as
the "<B>Additional Terms</B>."  If Additional Terms apply, they will be
accessible to you either within or through your use of the applicable
Google Services.  If there is any contradiction between the Additional
Terms and the Maps APIs Terms, then the Maps APIs Terms will take
precedence only as it relates to the Maps APIs, and not to any other
Google Services.<BR>
<BR>
1.4   <U>Precedence of Maps APIs Terms</U>.  If there is any contradiction
between the Maps APIs Terms and other Maps API-related documents
(including but not limited to the Maps APIs Documentation), then the
Maps APIs Terms will take
precedence. <BR>
<BR>
1.5    <U>Changes to the Terms</U>.  Google reserves the right to
make changes to the Terms from time to time. When these changes
are made, Google will make a new copy of the Terms available at <A href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/terms.html" target="_top">http://code.google.com/apis/maps/terms.html</A>.
You understand and agree that if you use the Service after the date on
which the Terms have changed, Google will treat your use as acceptance
of the updated Terms.  If a modification is unacceptable to you, you
may terminate the agreement by ceasing use of the Maps APIs.<BR>
<BR>
<B>2.    Accepting the Terms.<BR>
<BR>
</B>
<A id="section_2_1"></A>
2.1    <U>Clicking to Accept or Using the Maps APIs</U>.  In order
to use the Maps APIs you must agree to the Terms.  You can accept the
Terms by:<BR>
 <BR>
<DIV style="margin-left: 40px;">
         (a) clicking to accept or agree to the Terms, where this option
         is made available to you by Google in the user interface for
         the Service; or<BR>
         (b) using the Maps APIs.  In this case, you understand and agree
         that Google will treat your use of the Maps APIs as acceptance
         of the Terms from that point onwards.<BR>
</DIV>
<BR>
2.2    <U>U.S. Law Restrictions</U>.  You may not use the Maps APIs
and may not accept the Terms if you are a person barred from using the
Service under the laws of the United States.<BR>
<BR>
2.3    <U>Authority to Accept the Terms</U>.  You represent that you have
full power, capacity and authority to accept these Terms.  If you are
accepting on behalf of your employer or another entity, you represent
that you have full legal authority to bind your employer or such entity
to these Terms.  If you don't have the legal authority to bind, please
ensure that an authorized person from your entity consents to and accepts
these Terms.<BR>
<BR>
<B>3.    Privacy and Personal Information.<BR>
<BR>
</B>3.1    <U>Google's Privacy Policy</U>.  For information about
Google's data protection practices, please read Google's privacy policy
at <A href="http://www.google.com/privacy.html" target="_top">
http://www.google.com/privacy.html</A>.  This policy explains how Google
treats your personal information and protects your privacy when you use
the Service.<BR>
<BR>
3.2    <U>Use of Your Data under Google's Privacy Policy</U>.  You agree
to the use of your data in accordance with Google's privacy policy.<BR>
<BR>
3.3    <U>Your Privacy Policy</U>.  You must post and abide by an
appropriate privacy policy, and will comply with all applicable
laws relating to the collection of information from visitors to Your
Maps API Implementation in accordance with Section 9.2 below.<SPAN style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);"></SPAN><BR>
<BR>
<B>4.    Provision of Service by Google.</B><BR>
<BR>
4.1    <U>Google's Subsidiaries and Affiliates</U>.  Google has
subsidiaries and affiliated legal entities around the world
("<B>Subsidiaries and Affiliates</B>").  Sometimes, these companies
will be providing the Service to you on behalf of Google itself.
You acknowledge and agree that Subsidiaries and Affiliates will be
entitled to provide the Service to you.<BR>
<BR>
4.2    <U>Limits on Your Use of the Service</U>.  You acknowledge and agree
that Google may impose or adjust the limit on the number of transactions
you may send or receive through the Service; such fixed upper limits
may be set by Google at any time, at Google's discretion.<SPAN style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 0);"></SPAN><BR>
<DIV>
  <BR>
<A id="section_4_3"></A>
  4.3    <U>Advertising</U>.  The Service currently does not include
  advertising in the maps images.  <SPAN style="background-color:
  rgb(255, 255, 255);">However, Google reserves the right to
  include advertising in the maps images provided to you through
  the Service, but will provide you with ninety (90) days notice
  prior to the commencement of advertising in the maps images. Such notice may be
  provided on relevant Google websites, including but not limited
  to the </SPAN><A style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" id="ygto" href="http://googlegeodevelopers.blogspot.com/" target="_top" title="Google Geo Developers Blog">Google Geo Developers
  Blog</A><SPAN style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"> and the

  Maps API Group" target="_top">Google Maps API Group</A><SPAN style="background-color:
  rgb(255, 255, 255);"> (or such successor URLs that Google may designate
  from time to time).  </SPAN>During that 90 day period, you may terminate
  your use of the Service, or provide notice of your refusal to accept
  advertising in the maps images in accordance with Google's policies and procedures for
  providing such notice (which Google may make available from time to
  time in its sole discretion).<BR>
  <BR>
<A id="section_4_4"></A>
4.4 <U>Changes to the Service: Termination of the Service</U>.
<DIV style="margin-left: 40px;">
<BR>
  (a) If Google in its discretion chooses to cease providing the current 
  version of the Service whether through discontinuation of the Service 
  or by upgrading the Service to a newer version, the current version of 
  the Service will be deprecated and become the Deprecated Version of the
  Service. Google will issue an announcement if the current version of the
  Service will be deprecated.  For a period of 3 years after an announcement 
  (the “Deprecation Period”), Google will use commercially reasonable efforts 
  to continue to operate the Deprecated Version of the Service and to respond to
  problems with the Deprecated Version of the Service deemed by Google in its
  discretion to be critical.  During the Deprecation Period, no new features 
  will be added to the Deprecated Version of the Service.
<BR>
<BR>
  (b) Google reserves the right in its discretion to cease providing all or 
  any part of the Deprecated Version of the Service immediately without any 
  notice if:
<BR>
<DIV style="margin-left: 40px;">
    (i) you have breached any provision of the Terms (or have acted in manner 
    that clearly shows that you do not intend to, or are unable to comply with 
    the provisions of the Terms); or
<BR>
<BR>
    (ii) Google is required to do so by law (for example, due to a change to the 
    law governing the provision of the Deprecated Version of the Service); or
<BR>
<BR>
    (iii) the Deprecated Version of the Service relies on data or services 
    provided by a third party partner and the relationship with such partner 
    (x) has expired or been terminated or (y) requires Google to change the way 
    Google provides the data or services through the Deprecated Version of the 
    Service; or
<BR>
<BR>
    (iv) providing the Deprecated Version of the Service could create a 
    substantial economic burden as determined by Google in its reasonable good 
    faith judgment; or
<BR>
<BR>
    (v) providing the Deprecated Version of the Service could create a security 
    risk or material technical burden as determined by Google in its reasonable 
    good faith judgment.
<BR>
</DIV>
  (c) Google is constantly innovating in order to provide the best possible 
  experience for its users.  At any time prior to discontinuing the current 
  version of the Service or upgrading to a new version of the Service, Google 
  may, in its discretion as part of this continuing innovation, label certain 
  features or functionality of the Service as "experimental."  Additionally, Google 
  may elect to offer a version of the Service within Google Labs. This Section 
  4.4 of the Terms will not apply to any features or functionality labeled as 
  "experimental," or to any version of the Service offered within Labs.
<BR>
</DIV>
<BR>
  <B>5.    Your Google Account.<BR>
  <BR>
<A id="section_5_1"></A>
  </B>5.1    <U>Signing Up for a Google Account</U>.  In order to access
  the Service, you must have a <A href="http://www.google.com/accounts/" target="_top">

             of a third party. <BR>
</DIV>
  <BR> 15.2    You will cooperate as fully as reasonably required in the
  defense of any claim.  Google reserves the right, at its own expense,
  to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to

  equitable relief, including but not limited to preliminary injunction
  and injunction, in addition to all other remedies.<BR> <BR> <B>16.
  Copyright Policies.</B><BR> <BR> It is Google's policy to respond to

  such websites or resources.<BR> <BR> 17.2    You acknowledge and agree
  that Google is not liable for any loss or damage that may be incurred by

  remedy contained in the Terms (or that Google has the benefit of under
  any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver of
  Google's rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available
  to Google.  Any waiver of any provision of these Terms will be effective
  only if Google expressly states in a signed writing that it is waiving a
  specified Term.<BR> <BR> 19.3    <U>Severability</U>.  If any court of law
  that has jurisdiction rules that any provision of these Terms is invalid,
  then that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the
  rest of the Terms.  The remaining provisions of the Terms will continue to
  be valid and enforceable.<BR> <BR> 19.4    <U>Third Party Beneficiaries</U>.
  You acknowledge and agree that each member of the group of companies of which
  Google is the parent will be third party beneficiaries to the Terms and that
  such other companies will be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon,
  any provision of the Terms that confers a benefit on (or rights in favor
  of) them.  Other than this, no other person or company will be a third party
  beneficiary to the Terms.<BR> <BR> 19.5    <U>Assignment</U>.  The Terms
  may be assigned by Google and will inure to the benefit of Google, its
  successors and assigns.<BR> <BR> 19.6    <U>Governing Law and Jurisdiction;
  Injunctive Relief</U>.  The Terms, and your relationship with Google under
  the Terms, will be governed by the laws of the State of California, USA,
  without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.  You and Google agree to
  submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in the County
  of Santa Clara, California, USA, to resolve any legal matter arising from
  the Terms.  Notwithstanding this, you agree that Google will be allowed
  to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of urgent legal
  relief) in any jurisdiction.<BR> <BR> 19.7    <U>Complete Agreement</U>.
  The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and Google and
  govern your use of the Service and Content, and completely replace and
  supersede any prior agreements between you and Google, written or oral,
  in relation to the Service and Content.<BR> <BR> <BR>
