so far, my most valuable resource has been <a href= "http://econym.org.uk/gmap/">http://econym.org.uk/gmap/</a>, <br>a tutorial website administered by Mike Williams.<br> I am really appreciative to know that javascript has a Sheldon Brown too.<br><br>
<a href= "http://johngravois.com/map/example1/">example 1</a> - a simple map with coordinates stored inside the htm document<br>
<a href= "http://johngravois.com/map/example2/">example 2</a> - coordinates still stored in map document, with clickable sidebar
