      Hello hello,

So another year come and gone at the usual breakneck speed.  I don=92t have
too much to report from Redlands.  I=92ve been lucky enough to maintain
contact with many of you via email, facebook <http://www.facebook.com/>,
twitter and the rest.  As much as technology can be a burden, its been
really great hearing about your opinions and exploits and checking out link=
s
to the things you find interesting, thought provoking or infuriating.

I was so glad when my mom and bill decided to move to the neighborhood and
enjoy riding my bike up to their house for frequent visits.  They=92ve done=
 a
great job fixing up their new house with very little help from me.  Its als=
o
been so wonderful spending time with
jack<http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/01ycqPKT8nMg7I2Q7a6DsA?feat=3Ddir=
ectlink>as
he grows and catching up with scott, jenn, jill and michael while he=92s
taking naps.   I=92m also honored to now be playing honorary uncle to ryan =
and
jocelyn=92s first, miles
adrian<http://picasaweb.google.com/jagravois/2010_11#5540792376846440754>
.

With regard to my job, I have made many good friends and have found my work
both challenging and rewarding.  For some reason or other, they decided to
feature me in the department blog as the first in a series of employee
interviews<http://blogs.esri.com/Support/blogs/supportcenter/archive/2010/1=
1/17/getting-to-know-esri-support.aspx#comments>.
 As lovely as life in a cubicle can be, my vacation in New
York<http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Sgk0AuVq7V8VLLLPk27SfA?feat=3Ddir=
ectlink>and
several trips to
Sacramento<http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/LTdXskyQXqxDtHdfo88o6g?feat=
=3Ddirectlink>were
an enjoyable change of pace.

As far as bicycles go, I finally bought my first mountain bike and have
spent many an enjoyable afternoon =93roosting it=94 with
wes<http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/u19mUPjpltTaudulRs5Qbg?feat=3Ddire=
ctlink>in
the hills surrounding the inland empire.  I=92m still racing here and
there, and was also lucky enough to bike from San Diego to Orange over two
days with my friend Matt Baker.  Since, he and I founded a do-it-yourself
bike repair stand at our weekly Market Night <http://www.bikebbq.com/> in
Redlands.

I=92ve also found that living in Redlands makes it more convenient to get
together with my Dad and Kim and have really enjoyed being in attendance at
my little sister Holly=92s first few public
performances<http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=3D1755316683920&comm=
ents>.
 She is a talented songwriter, a strong singer, and plays my heck out of my
guitar too!

Lastly=85 in the midst of some pretty halfhearted house hunting, I fell in
love with a Victorian<http://www.redfin.com/CA/Redlands/603-E-Central-Ave-9=
2374/home/3211369>in
town and have put in an offer to buy it.  No promises yet, but if all
goes well I will have nothing to report next year but a series of weekends
stripping wallpaper, sanding floors and doing yard work.
I love you all and wish you and your families nothing but happiness in the
coming year.

John (and ray)<http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/h5X68lzCMa68PeYlDbmgQg?=
