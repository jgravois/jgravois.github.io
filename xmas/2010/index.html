      <p>Hello hello,</p>

      <p>So another year come and gone at the usual breakneck speed.  I don't have too much to report from Redlands.  I've been lucky enough to maintain contact with many of you via email, facebook, twitter and the rest.  As much as technology can be a burden, its been really great hearing about your opinions and exploits and checking out links to the things you find interesting, thought provoking or infuriating.</p>

      <p>I was so glad when my mom and bill decided to move to the neighborhood and enjoy riding my bike up to their house for frequent visits.  They've done a great job fixing up their new house with very little help from me.  It has also been so wonderful spending time with jack as he grows and catching up with scott, jenn, jill and michael while he's taking naps. I'm also honored to now be playing honorary uncle to ryan and jocelyn's first, miles adrian.</p>

      <p>With regard to my job, I have made many good friends and have found my work both challenging and rewarding.  For some reason or other, they decided to feature me in the department blog as the first in a series of employee interviews. As lovely as life in a cubicle can be, my vacation in New York and several trips to Sacramento were an enjoyable change of pace.</p>

      <p>As far as bicycles go, I finally bought my first mountain bike and have spent many an enjoyable afternoon &quot;roosting it&quot; with wes in the hills surrounding the inland empire.  I'm still racing here and there, and was also lucky enough to bike from San Diego to Orange over two days with my friend Matt Baker.  Since, he and I founded a do-it-yourself
      bike repair stand at our weekly Market Night in Redlands.</p>

      <p>I've also found that living in Redlands makes it more convenient to get together with my Dad and Kim and have really enjoyed being in attendance at my little sister Holly's first few public performances. She is a talented songwriter, a strong singer, and plays my heck out of my guitar too!</p>

      <p>Lastly, in the midst of some pretty halfhearted house hunting, I fell in love with a Victorian in town and have put in an offer to buy it.  No promises yet, but if all goes well I will have nothing to report next year but a series of weekends
      stripping wallpaper, sanding floors and doing yard work.
      I love you all and wish you and your families nothing but happiness in the coming year.</p>

      <p>John (and ray)</p>
