      <p>In case you aren't counting along at home, this is the 13th installment of our Gravois holiday greeting. The <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=tl%3Bdr">tl;dr</a> is that we're (mostly) unpacked in San Juan Capistrano and settling in just fine.</p>

            <p>"When I was a boy of 14, my father was so ignorant I could hardly stand to have the old man around. But when I got to be 21, I was astonished at how much the old man had learned in seven years."</p>

      <p>The older I get the more difficult it becomes to pass off anything resembling a nugget of wisdom that isn't an immediately recognizable platitude or cliche. I haven't suddenly become unoriginal, I'd wager I'm just figuring out later than most that my elders pretty well covered the bases.</p>

      <p>This year I clocked the usual number of hours fighting with computers to pay the bills. We spent plenty of time exploring outside too though. I threw the ball to the dog a few thousand times and pedaled over to the playground to dig in the sand. Zu and I even took a couple train rides just for the hell of it.</p>

      <p>Left to my own designs, I'd probably still be toiling away trying to perfect the same loaf of bread I started with. Luckily I have Kacie to remind me to branch out a little.</p>

      <p>My pizzas aren't great yet, but they're getting better.</p>

      <p>With love,</p>
      <p>- John, Kacie and Zuzu</p>
