      <h3>2024.12.31</h3>
      <p>the gravois family had a lot to be grateful for in 2024. zuzu is thriving in kindergarten. i finally replaced my 25 year old tennis racket and kacie is doing so much sewing that the girls at Joann's are starting to greet her by name.</p>
      <p>a short trip to Washington and another to Mexico City reminded us how much fun traveling can be. i made a few more visits to see my dad in the hospital than i would have liked, but i am happy to report that he's rallying now.</p>
      <p>here's to a 2025 filled with good fortune and time with family and friends. when the challenges come (and lord knows they will) may we all summon the resolve to face them head on, and never alone.</p>
      <p>with love, ðŸ«¶</br>john, kacie + zuzu</p>
