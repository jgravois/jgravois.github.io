      <h3>2023.12.31</h3>
      <p>ðŸ‘‹ from san juan capistrano!</p>
      <p>this year kacie parented, finished her bachelors degree, sewed miniature dresses and started teaching preschool. zuzu transformed from a toddler to a full-fledged human being. i just played an absurd amount of pickleball and ran the dogs.</p>
      <p>all curated recaps aside, we really struggled early in the year. I say that with the utmost humility. i know we're playing life on 'easy mode' compared to many others in the U.S. and around the world. mercifully, the fracas helped us cultivate an even more profound appreciation for our family, friends and each other.</p>
      <p>as i write this note i feel as peaceful, whole and grateful as anytime i can remember. i sincerely hope you can say the same.</p>
      <p>as ever, ðŸ«¶</br>john, kacie + zuzu</p>
