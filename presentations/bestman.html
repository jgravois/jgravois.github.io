      My sincere gratitude to (insert parents names here) and Ben and Hilary as
      well for asking me to share in this joyous occasion. It makes me
      exceedingly proud to get up here and speak to you all on behalf of my
      best friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you don't know who I am (and there's a good chance you don't), I am
      the guy that went with Ben down to Antarctica and fell overboard. But,
      that is a story for another night. All you need to know right now is that
      my name is John and that I was lucky enough to be working with Ben "on
      deck" down at the Docklands when he and Hilary first met. As glamorous
      and dangerous as they make the pirate life out to be, in the summer of
      2006 we were spending the majority of our time chipping rust and painting
      things, so the arrival of Hilary and the cosmopolitan ladies she was
      running with at the time for a photoshoot was really quite the spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ben was understandably immediately smitten, but he is also shy, and we
      had a trip to Antarctica to make. Between Hilary's relocation to London
      and Ben hopping from the South Pole to the Galapagos to various couches
      of mine in North America, it took some time for their love affair to
      blossom. I listened to Ben sit in front of his laptop and giggle while
      the two of them Skyped in both hemispheres. Somehow, by grace, I was
      lucky enough to welcome Hilary into my home in America and look on as the
      two of them finally said, "to hell with geography". It was an organic,
      wholesome, foregone conclusion from day one. When Ben worked up the nerve
      to tell me that he and Hilary were finally an item, I didn't have the
      heart to tell him that I had seen the news coming half a decade away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ben really is extra-ordinary. He has what I would call "fierce
      integrity". He is extremely hard on himself and extremely understanding
      of others. He's the only person I know that actually doesn't know how
      handsome he is. He can look at a schematic or a machine or piece of
      woodwork and understand the function each part plays immediately.
      Sometimes, he doesn't even have to look. He told me how to fix my garbage
      disposal over the phone.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, what is it that makes Ben and Hilary so perfect together?  I don't kid 
	  myself for a second that Hilary is going to make her mark in this world by 
	  scrubbing Ben's ears and forcing him to eat something other than baked 
	  beans and chips and hummus. She is a fucking brilliant photographer and 
	  she's a much more enthusiastic traveler than Ben.  She's going to drag him 
	  all sorts of wonderful places and they're going to have a sickeningly good 
	  time when they are by one another's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hilary and Ben share the sort of character, worldview and values that
      form the foundation of successful relationships, but they also have a
      seemingly limitless patience, understanding and appreciation for the
      traits which make the other person unique. Their shared delight in
      honoring and accommodating their partners idiocyncracies is absolutely
      precious to see, and I truly believe its going to be what keeps them
      passionately in love until the day they die.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, please raise your glasses and...
    </p>
