<p>introduce yourself and group.  ask what people are most curious about.

<p>send people who want to fix flat tires group out with david...

<h2>1. A checklist for periodic tune-ups</h2>

<p>keeping tires pumped up and lubricating your chain are the only skills that should be considered absolutely mandatory to be able to ride a bike for transportation</p>

<p>while people typically cite bike 'performance' as the primary motivating factor for spending more money on a bike, dependability and ease of ownership are significantly more important.</p>

<p>there is no right or wrong answer to the question, 'how much should i spend?', because each person has a different tolerance for the amount of tinkering which is necessary to keep a bike running.</p>

<h4>safety check</h4>
a. check hubs, bottom bracket and stem to ensure that they are properly adjusted</br>
b. check brakes to ensure that they provide appropriate stopping power, (and don't squeak excessively.)

<p>if not, are the pads touching the rim wall (and rim wall only)?
has the cable stretched, or become caught on something?
are the brakes, 'toed-in'?
is the surface of the pad brittle?
what about bikes with steel wheels?</p>

<h4>we'll get to shifting later</h4>

<h2>2. Adjusting brakes</h2>

<p>cable stretch is a natural part of life.  that's why barrel adjusters were invented</p>

<h4>caliper brakes</h4>
<p>side-pull brakes are easier to work on than center-pull brakes</br>
most(not all) nice caliper brakes have a adjustment bolt in the middle of the brake assembly for centering.</br>
the back bolt controls assembly installation</br>
the front bolt (if present) often controls load on springs</p>

<h4>cantilever and v-brakes</h4>
<p>why are they used?
a noodle allows quick disassembly to remove larger wheels</br>
spring tension on both arms is necessary to keep pads off the wheel.</br>
install pin often has three possible locations, best to start with the middle</br>
sometimes the spring itself can be bent to provide more spring, sometimes not.</p>



<h2>3. Fine-tuning shifting</h2>
<p>a. make sure derailleur hanger is straight (in front make sure arm is parallel and close to chainring)</br>
b. set limit screws</br>
c. add cable tension, (shouldn't take a lot).</br>
d. if its still not shifting right, even after recabling the bike, its likely that either the cassette, chain or both are worn out.</p>


<h2>4. Finding/fixing squeaks and other strange noises</h2>
<p>do you hear it when you're coasting?</br>
don't be afraid to swap parts out to help find the culprit</p>

<p>if you really just wanted an excuse to buy a new bike, i support you!</p>
