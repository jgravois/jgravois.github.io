## Webfonts

This application uses a custom webfont created on [Fontello](http://fontello.com/). If you're hosting this application on your own server, make sure that it's configured to host the webfont files with the correct mime types. Some servers require a mime type set for these files to be able to serve them correctly. See the following URLs for more information. There is a zip archive of the webfont with it's fontello config in the "resources" folder in this repository.
